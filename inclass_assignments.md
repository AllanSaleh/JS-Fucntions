# Lesson 2: In-Class Assignments

## Integrated Practice Sessions

These assignments are designed to be completed during the lesson as you learn each concept, rather than all at the end.

## Assignment 1: Function Basics (10 minutes)

### Objective
Practice creating different types of functions and understanding their syntax.

### Instructions
1. Add this code to your existing JavaScript file:

```javascript
// 1. Create a function declaration that calculates the area of a rectangle


// 2. Create a function expression that calculates the perimeter


// 3. Create an arrow function that calculates the diagonal


// 4. Test all functions
let length = 5;
let width = 3;

console.log("=== Rectangle Calculations ===");
console.log(`Length: ${length}, Width: ${width}`);
console.log(`Area: ${calculateArea(length, width)}`);
console.log(`Perimeter: ${calculatePerimeter(length, width)}`);
console.log(`Diagonal: ${calculateDiagonal(length, width).toFixed(2)}`);
```

### Expected Output
Your console should display:
- Length and width values
- Calculated area
- Calculated perimeter
- Calculated diagonal (rounded to 2 decimal places)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Function declaration works correctly
- [ ] Function expression works correctly
- [ ] Arrow function works correctly
- [ ] All calculations are accurate
- [ ] Output is clearly formatted
